# threads
* differentiate thread vs. execution, thread is just the "handle" which runs the function
* thread creator
  * t.join() waits for child
  * t.deatch() detaches from  child (thread becomes daemon thread)
* thread lifetime
  * a thread is joinable if join() or detach() not performed
  * joinable thread calls std::terminate in its destructor
* thread args
  * threads should get its arguments by copy (so validity of data is ensured)
