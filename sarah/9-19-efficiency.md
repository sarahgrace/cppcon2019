* compute per watt dominates
  * at the smallest level -> phones
  * at the largest level -> data centers
* c++ doesn't give you performance, it gives you *control* over performance
* efficiency: how much work required by a task
  * an efficient program is one which does the minimum amount of work (that we're aware of) that accomplishes the task
* performace: how quickly a program does its work
  * improving performance involves doing work faster
1. efficiency through algorithms
2. performance through data structures
